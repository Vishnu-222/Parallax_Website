            <p class="text">
                Surfing is a dynamic water sport that involves riding waves while standing or lying on a surfboard. Originating in ancient Polynesian cultures, it has evolved into a popular global activity.
                Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board.
                <br><br>
                 Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand.
